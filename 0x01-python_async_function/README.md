## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to  [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/pHTXFHHxknuUm8ATIXAn3Q "explain to anyone"),  **without the help of Google**:

-   `async`  and  `await`  syntax
-   How to execute an async program with  `asyncio`
-   How to run concurrent coroutines
-   How to create  `asyncio`  tasks
-   How to use the  `random`  module

## Requirements

### General

-   A  `README.md`  file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
-   Allowed editors:  `vi`,  `vim`,  `emacs`
-   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using  `python3`  (version 3.7)
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   All your files must be executable
-   The length of your files will be tested using  `wc`
-   The first line of all your files should be exactly  `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
-   Your code should use the  `pycodestyle`  style (version 2.5.x)
-   All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
-   All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
-   All your functions should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`
-   A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
