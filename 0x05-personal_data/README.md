## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to  [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/ss0S_w-UwmFsL2ITgpK_TA "explain to anyone"),  **without the help of Google**:

-   Examples of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
-   How to implement a log filter that will obfuscate PII fields
-   How to encrypt a password and check the validity of an input password
-   How to authenticate to a database using environment variables

## Requirements

-   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using  `python3`  (version 3.7)
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   The first line of all your files should be exactly  `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
-   A  `README.md`  file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
-   Your code should use the  `pycodestyle`  style (version 2.5)
-   All your files must be executable
-   The length of your files will be tested using  `wc`
-   All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
-   All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
-   All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`  and  `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
-   A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
-   All your functions should be type annotated
